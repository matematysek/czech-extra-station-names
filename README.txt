# Czech Extra Station Names NewGRF

### Features

* This GRF adds extra station name strings for when all the default names have been used up, instead of "Town Station #NNN", that are localised to Czech.

### Requirements

* This GRF requires a non-standard version of OpenTTD which supports the extra station names feature such as [JGR's patchpack](https://github.com/JGRennison/OpenTTD-patches) v0.42.3 or later.

* There is a parameter to set the probability of using an extra station name before all the default names have been used up. For this parameter to take effect a version of OpenTTD which supports this feature is required, such as [JGR's patchpack](https://github.com/JGRennison/OpenTTD-patches) v0.47.2 or later.

### Development

* For GRF author documentation of the extra station names feature , [see here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JGRennison/OpenTTD-patches/blob/jgrpp/docs/newgrf-additions.html#a0globalsettings).
